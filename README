  Primitive visualizer for IonMonkey graphs using GraphViz.
  Doesn't involve HTML5. Generated images and DOT files are saved on disk.

IONMONKEY

  IonMonkey is a compiler for JavaScript that uses an SSA-form IR.
  IonMonkey may be downloaded from http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ionmonkey.

USAGE

  IonMonkey, when it runs without asserting, dumps a JSON file that contains
  observations about graph state after various passes into /tmp/ion.json.

  Executing 'make' reads in this file, outputs a DOT file for each function
  and for each pass for each function, and then generates PNG images from
  those DOT files.

  Iterating over those PNG files crudely shows changes to the graph over time.

GRAPH PROPERTIES

  Blocks with green borders are loop headers.
  Blocks with red borders contain loop backedges (successor is a header).
	Blocks with blue borders were created during critical edge splitting.

  Edges from blocks ending with conditional branches are annotated with
    the truth value associated with each edge, given as '0' or '1'.
